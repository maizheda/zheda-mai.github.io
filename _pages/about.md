# About me

I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute. My supervisors are [Prof. Amir-massoud Farahmand](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/amir-massoud-farahmand/) and [Prof. Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). 

My primary research interests are in the security and adversarial robustness of learning algorithms.

Prior to coming to UofT, I studied at the University of Waterloo, where I completed my BASc. in Mechatronics Engineering, and MASc. in Systems Design Engineering. During Masters, I worked at the Vision and Image Processing ([VIP](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/)) Lab, supervised by [Prof. Alex Wong](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~a28wong/index.html) and [Prof. David Clausi](https://uwaterloo.ca/vision-image-processing-lab/people-profiles/david-clausi).

<!-- During the first year of my MASc., I worked as a research engineer intern with [Christie Digital](https://www.christiedigital.com/en-us), a Canadian projector technology company. There I collaborated with a team of Christie engineers on achieving [projector super-resolution enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_imaging) - extending the resolution of projectors beyond their hardware capabilities.

My Master’s thesis focuses on 3D reconstruction technologies. I am building a novel active depth sensing system that infers depth by analyzing the blurriness of the projection pattern at different depth levels caused by camera defocus. Without relying on complex hardware, I developed a computational depth inference model based on parametric estimation approach([Gaussian based](http://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/vsl/article/view/96)) and non-parametric estimation ([Deep learning-driven](http://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/vsl/article/view/165)). -->
